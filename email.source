-- Creating a new type:
--	We are going to create a new type called 'email' which represents
--	email address.
--	A user-defined type must have an input and an output function, and
--	optionally can have binary input and output functions.  All of these
--	are usually user-defined C functions.
-----------------------------

-- Assume the user defined functions are in _OBJWD_/email$DLSUFFIX
-- (we do not want to assume this is in the dynamic loader search path).
-- Look at $PWD/email.c for the source.  Note that we declare all of
-- them as STRICT, so we do not need to cope with NULL inputs in the
-- C code.  We also mark them IMMUTABLE, since they always return the
-- same outputs given the same inputs.

-- the input function 'email_in' takes a null-terminated string (the
-- textual representation of the type) and turns it into the internal
-- (in memory) representation. You will get a message telling you 'complex'
-- does not exist yet but that's okay.

CREATE FUNCTION email_in(cstring)
   RETURNS EmailAddress
   AS '_OBJWD_/email'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

-- the output function 'email_out' takes the internal representation and
-- converts it into the textual representation.

CREATE FUNCTION email_out(EmailAddress)
   RETURNS cstring
   AS '_OBJWD_/email'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

-- the binary input function 'email_recv' takes a StringInfo buffer
-- and turns its contents into the internal representation.

CREATE FUNCTION email_recv(internal)
   RETURNS EmailAddress
   AS '_OBJWD_/email'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

-- the binary output function 'email_send' takes the internal representation
-- and converts it into a (hopefully) platform-independent bytea string.

CREATE FUNCTION email_send(EmailAddress)
   RETURNS bytea
   AS '_OBJWD_/email'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;


-- now, we can create the type. The internallength specifies the size of the
-- memory block required to hold the type (we need two 8-byte doubles).

CREATE TYPE EmailAddress (
   internallength = 256,
   input = email_in,
   output = email_out,
   receive = email_recv,
   send = email_send,
   alignment = char 
);


-----------------------------
-- Using the new type:
--	user-defined types can be used like ordinary built-in types.

-- Interfacing New Types with Indexes:
--	We cannot define a secondary index (eg. a B-tree) over the new type
--	yet. We need to create all the required operators and support
--      functions, then we can make the operator class.
-----------------------------
